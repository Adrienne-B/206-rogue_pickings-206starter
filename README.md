# Summary 
This project was all about making a static website responsive. By doing this I had to to incoroporate breaking points and media queries for all three devices :mobile, tablet, and desktop.
Although there are muliple tabs in the navigation bar, the focus was on the layout not necessarily the function of this website.

### Description/ walk-through
This website was very simplistic regarding the color theme. Looking at the overall website
you will see the business name/logo, the navigtion with multiple tabs, one image, welcoming intro, 
a paragraph underneath, and  three sections side by side of  more in detail about what the 
fictional businesss offers regarding fresh and organic foods.

#### Software used:
Adobe Dreamweaver (text-editor)

#### What I learn:
Since I had past experience on the basics of HTML and CSS, that was more of a breeze. But, the challenge was fusing flexbox and media queries in order to create three different layouts to be cohesive to
the device used 

##### Challenges to improve on
1. I didn't understand the the importance of creating multiple classes/id's and how to use them
2. I didnt know how to take certain selectors and articles in css in order to create a certain style
3. Flexbox is a challenge which I need to work on more.
4. Margins and Paddings
5. Lining up the gray lines so that each column of information at the same height and similar width

##### Solutions/solving the issue:
1. Months later I went back to look at past mistakes. I noticed that I used too high of a number for margins and paddings to move elements in certain locations
in the website, which is a no-no as a coder.

2. I used height em/rems so that the section that had information inside of boxes were similar in height.

3. I made the layout for html and css more cleaner and understood 

4. organized each section by name in the comments <!-- --> and /** **/
(they aren't just for reminders.)
